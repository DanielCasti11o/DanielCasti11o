## 🌟 Current Project: FDF

**FDF** is a 3D wireframe viewer. This project focuses on:

- 📊 Visualizing 3D landscapes from 2D maps.
- 🖥️ Understanding computer graphics basics.
- 🔧 Leveraging the MLX library for graphical output.

### 🛠️ Goals for FDF:

- Render 3D wireframe maps with proper projection.
- Add features like rotation, zoom, and color schemes.
- Ensure smooth navigation and interaction.

Stay tuned for updates on this project! I'll be sharing progress, challenges, and insights as I go.
