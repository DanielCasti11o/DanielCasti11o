Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a student at **42**, an innovative programming school where creativity, collaboration, and problem-solving take the front seat. My GitHub username is **DanielCasti11o**, and my 42 login is **dacastil**.

I thrive on tackling challenging projects and learning through hands-on experience. Currently, I'm collaborating with [sbolivar](https://github.com/s-bolivar) on exciting projects like **Philosophers** and **Minishell**. Previously, I worked on **FDF** and **Pipex**, exploring computer graphics and system-level programming.

##  Projects

Some of the projects I've worked on so far include:

- **Pipex**: Simulating the behavior of shell pipes.
- **FDF**: Visualizing wireframe models with 3D projections.
- **Push_swap**: Optimizing sorting algorithms for stacks.
- **Get_next_line**: Reading lines from a file efficiently.
- **ft_printf**: Recreating the functionality of the standard `printf`.

Each project has helped me develop skills in C programming, algorithm optimization, and debugging.
